        <h2 class="titleText">Grid</h2><p class="contentText">I'm still learning how to use this successfully. For many of the layouts that I needed Grid would have worked. But some of the setting are harder to understand since they're two-dimensional in use. This video I found last minute when doing this assignment, wish I had found it earlier. Looking forward to going through a view more of this page's videos to hopefully get the hand of creating grid-based layouts. A feature I am looking forward to using in Grid are complex layouts that I haven't been able to realize in Flexbox. I was able to get the same look that I wanted with less code using Grid which is always a plus.</p>

<h2 class="titleText">Flexbox</h2>
<p class="contentText">Flexbox was definitely my go-to method for responsive design. Before this I would simply use block elements, margin settings, and media queries. And although media queries are still useful for various viewports and devices, I'm able to write much less code with Flexbox. A feature I am looking forward to using in Flexbox is column and/or row reverse. When working with tabular data, it'd definitely be helpful to view information in alphabetical, numerical, or other order decided by the user similar to how Flash use to. I'm sure that I could come up with some type of animation coupled with the order property that will sort row and column data similar to how it's done in Excel.</p>
