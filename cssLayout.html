        <p class="contentText">W3School's interactive layout tutorials were my #1 go-to for design. They were easy to follow, and as a visual learner, they helped me retain the information that I had learned better. Being able to tweak the design and see each change almost instantly was a plus as well. I didn't have to worry much about the limits of my browser since they use iframes for their content. The most important piece of information was about media queries for different viewports and devices. Instead of creating a lot of separate code for each elements I could simply create a media query and tweak multiple elements at once based on size and resolution of different devices.</p>

		<p class="contentText">Matthew's website was really fun and informative. He included some of the most used layouts and has visual representations of each. The most important thing about his site is that he shows both Flexbox, Grid, CSS3, and HTML5 code respectively. So no matter which layout you choose, you can rest assured that it will work well in modern browsers and devices.</p><p></p>
